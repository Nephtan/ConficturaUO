**Important Shard Update Announcement!**

Greetings, fellow adventurers! As the custodian of our mystical realm, it is my duty and pleasure to unveil the latest enhancements and adjustments that await within our boundaries:

**Offline Study Manuals - Effective Immediately:**
- **Simplified Skill Gain:** We have refined the way skills are mastered in our world. The probability of skill improvement now gracefully decreases from a lofty 90% down to a mere 10% as you approach the pinnacle of your skill's potential. This change ensures a smoother and more predictable journey towards mastery.
- Fear not, for the essence of fairness has been infused into the process, with the chances of skill gain firmly set between the realms of 10% and 90%.

**MageAI NPCs Adjustment - Commencing at Dawn’s Light on the Morrow:**
- **A New Dawn for MageAI:** Starting at the first light of 9am Central Time, USA, on the morrow of Wednesday, March 6th, 2024, those wizards and witches among you who command summons will notice a change. The likelihood of dispelling player-summoned creatures has been tempered, reduced from the once overwhelming 75% to a more balanced 50%. Moreover, your summoned companions now bear the gift of self-healing, a boon to aid them in their service to you.

I encourage all of you to embrace these changes with open minds and hearts, for they are but steps on our never-ending quest to enrich and balance our world.

May your paths be clear and your spells true,
**Nephtan**

Important Update and Feedback Request on Mage AI Behavior!

We've listened to your experiences and noticed that our Mage adversaries might have been a little too fond of their poison spells, casting them more frequently than we intended. In our quest to balance the thrill of battle and keep every encounter exciting yet fair, we've rolled out an update to the Mage AI's spellcasting behavior. Here's the scoop:

Adjustments to Poison Spell Casting:

- Introducing a Cooldown: We've implemented a cooldown system for poison spells to temper their frequency. After casting a poison spell, a Mage will now think twice before using it again, with a cooldown period of 30 seconds.
- Dynamic Casting Odds: Instead of a fixed chance, the likelihood of casting a poison spell again increases gradually over the cooldown period, from a low chance right after casting up to a full chance by the end of the cooldown.

The Numbers Behind the Change:

The chance of a Mage casting poison starts at 20% immediately after a cast and linearly climbs to 100% over the 30-second cooldown. This means that the Mages will diversify their spell usage, making combat encounters less predictable and more engaging.

Why We Need Your Feedback:

- Observing the Impact: While we believe this update will enhance combat dynamics, we're closely monitoring its effects. We need your insight to determine if the cooldown period hits the sweet spot or needs adjustment.
- Balancing Act: Our goal is to balance spell variety without making any single tactic (like poison) overwhelmingly common or scarce. Your feedback is crucial in fine-tuning this balance.

How to Share Your Thoughts:

After you've faced off against our updated Mages, please share your experiences:
- Was the poison spell used less frequently?
- Do battles feel more balanced and enjoyable?
- Is the 30-second cooldown on poison spells too long, too short, or just right?

Drop your feedback in the discord. Every bit of input helps us make our world more immersive and fun for everyone.

Thank you for your engagement and for helping us refine the magic of our realm. Your adventures fuel our world's evolution, and together, we'll ensure it remains a place of endless excitement and challenge!

Happy adventuring, and let the feedback flow!

Town Crier & Nephtan
Announcements:

Hear ye, hear ye!

Let it be known across the lands of Confictura, a dire peril has befallen the grand city of Britain. Adimarchus, the nefarious Daemon Prince of Madness, once sealed away by powerful magics, has broken the bonds of his arcane prison. With a horde of malevolent servants at his command, they lay siege to our beloved city, spreading chaos and destruction in their wake. The valiant town guards, though brave and true, found themselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of these fiendish foes.

Let this serve as a clarion call to all seasoned adventurers and valiant warriors of the realm: Britain needed your might, your wisdom, and your courage. Rallying to her defense, you faced the daemon and his servants of darkness head-on, a testament to the bravery and strength that define the heroes of Confictura.

A word of caution had been issued to the novices among us: the roads to Britain were fraught with peril, and the enemies within our gates were not to be underestimated. Many sought strength in numbers, allying themselves with more experienced comrades-in-arms, proving once again that together, we can overcome any onslaught and restore peace to our troubled lands.

The invasion has concluded. Thanks to the combined efforts of our adventurers and the town guards, who managed to beat back most of the spawn to the outer walls, the invasion did not escalate further and fizzled out. This event served as a crucial test of the invasion system, which, though not yet ready for full deployment, has shown great promise for the future.

The town crier will announce the next invasion when adjustments have been made and we are ready to test again. This endeavor has not only tested our defenses but also the strength of our community and the resolve of our heroes.

For Britain, for the realm, for victory! We look forward to standing together again in the face of whatever challenges may come next.

Dire Tidings from the Darkened Graves of Sosaria!

As nightfall drapes its velvet cloak across the lands of Confictura, a chilling spectacle unfolds within the hallowed and forgotten recesses of our cemeteries. Graveyards have become the breeding grounds for unspeakable horrors.

The Awakening of the Undead:

Under the pall of night, the earth trembles and fissures, as from the depths, undead creatures claw their way to the surface. These nocturnal horrors, driven by a malevolent force, seek to spread their curse across Sosaria.

The Emergence of Undead Nests:

In an ominous twist, some nights witness the opening of undead nests, unholy gateways from which an endless tide of these abominations pours forth. The air grows cold, the ground corrupt, as shadows twist and coalesce into forms both pitiful and terrifying.

The Call to Arms:

Hearken, brave adventurers of Confictura! The time has come to brandish your weapons and wield your magics against this nocturnal menace. Let us stand united, for only together can we quell the darkness that seeks to engulf our world.

Strategies for Survival:

- Vigilance is Key: Patrol the graveyards as dusk falls to preempt the rise of these horrors.
- Strength in Numbers: Form bands of warriors and mages; there is safety and power in alliances.
- Holy Relics and Enchantments: Arm yourselves with blessed artifacts and spells known to weaken the undead.
- Destroy the Nest: Melee attackers may double click the nest to attack it. Spellcasters may use AoE spells. Spellcasters or Marksmanship ranged attackers may target the nest directly by holding Ctrl+Shift to target its nameplate. All characters can drag the nest's health bar out by holding Ctrl+Shift and dragging it from the nest's nameplate.

In Unity, There is Hope:

This is a call not just to battle but to solidarity. Share your tales of valor, lend your strength to your fellows, and together, we shall restore peace to the night.

Remember, the spirit of Confictura is indomitable. Together, we shall protect our land from the shadows that seek to claim it.

To arms, heroes of Confictura! Let the darkness fear our resolve!

Long live the brave and the bold!

Changes:
 - When you log into the server you may notice some faces you're familiar with, but not normally used to seeing. The faces of your own characters as they inhabit the game world!! Starting now, an offline clone of every human character who has entered the world proper will be created on the very spot that character last logged out. The offline clone will have all of the character's stats, skills, and items equipped that the original character had on when they logged out. In addition, if a character's skill is high enough, their offline clone will be able to train other characters for gold in the same way vendors can train skills.

 - Added code to display Intelligence and Dexterity requirements on armor and weapons in the rare cases that they have them.
 - Moved certain roleplay-centric commands to Counselor access level for future scenarios.

Changes:
 - Implemented shove-through. This works like Felucca rules for shoving through other creatures. When you have full stamina, you can shove through an adjacent creature and you will lose some stamina. If you do not have full stamina, you can not shove through an adjacent creature.
 - Time between auto-saves decreased from 30 minutes to 10 minutes. In the event of a crash, we should never have to revert more than 10 minutes.

There have been some bugs reported and some bugs fixed thanks to all of the new players who have joined the server.

Info:
There are almost 300 classic artifacts in the game, as well as artifacts created for this game that are specifically named and designed. These are items like 'Stormbringer' or 'Conan's Lost Sword'. By default, these items will retain their appearance and color no matter what is done to them.
-----
Changes:
 - Wandering Healers piling up on their spawner in the middle of the ocean. This has been fixed.
 - The Dread Isles, Ice Island Dock. Code added to make it possible to dry dock boats here if a few players build a town nearby. Admin must activate.
 - Paperdoll gump shows only as horns on a grey human figure. This is fixed in the code and will activate at the next server restart. If your small fairy paperdoll gump is incorrect after the next server restart, contact a staff member to assist you.
