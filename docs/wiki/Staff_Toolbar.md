# Staff Toolbar

## Overview
The Staff Toolbar is a customizable command bar that displays a grid of buttons for quick staff actions. Counselors and higher receive it automatically at login or can open it at any time with `[Toolbar]`. New toolbars populate with common staff commands like `[Who]`, `[Where]`, `[Tele]`, and `[SpeedBoost]` depending on access level.

## Editing the Toolbar
1. Click the *Customize* button on the toolbar.
2. Adjust layout options:
   - **Skin** – switch between visual themes.
   - **Rows** and **Columns** – up to 15 rows and 9 columns.
   - **Font** – choose from preset text styles.
   - **Phantom** – makes the toolbar semi-transparent.
   - **Stealth** – auto-minimizes after a button is pressed.
   - **Reverse** – places the minimize bar above the toolbar.
   - **Lock** – prevents closing with a right-click.
3. Enter commands in the grid cells. Commands beginning with `[` execute server commands; other entries send speech.
4. Click *Apply* to save changes.

## Example
1. Type `[Toolbar]` to open the toolbar.
2. Press *Customize* and change **Columns** to `3` and **Rows** to `2` for a 3×2 grid.
3. In the first cell, enter `[Who]` to create a button that lists online players.
4. Set **Stealth** to keep the toolbar minimized after using a button.
5. Click *Apply* and press the new `[Who]` button to verify.
