Just as in real life, taxes are used to enhance the town ï¿½ or at least that's the hope. A significant amount of money flows into a city. There are maintenance charges, and civic buildings require money or resources. As your city grows, its upkeep costs increase. If there's insufficient money in the treasury, the city could vanish. Once your city reaches the point of levying taxes, it's advisable to start with a minimal amount. Citizens might be reluctant to pay taxes, but as the mayor, it's your responsibility to explain the utilization of these funds. It's also your duty to spend the money judiciously - or perhaps on that new katana you've been eyeing. As a mayor, you can withdraw funds from the treasury at will. However, be cautious: every online citizen is notified of such actions. If they're vigilant citizens, they'll want accountability for their tax money.<BR>During the City Update (tax time), funds are debited from both your and your citizens' bank accounts. Yes, even the mayor pays. If a citizen doesn't have sufficient gold in their bank, a check occurs every time they log in. This check deducts any available funds towards their overdue taxes or takes the entire amount if they can cover it. There's no opting out; it's part of city life.<BR>Overcharging can deter citizens from residing in your city. However, as mayor, you have the discretion to set tax rates, ranging from 0 (no taxes) to 10,000 weekly. There are three tax types: Income, Property, and Travel. Property taxes are deducted from citizens' bank accounts weekly, whereas income comes from their City Player Vendors. Travel taxes apply only when someone uses a civic moongate, either entering or leaving your city. This structure lets you impose fees on non-city members using your public moongates. If someone uses a public moongate outside your city to enter, they're also charged.<BR>Undercharging can deplete your funds in maintenance, potentially resulting in the loss of your city. The onus is on you, as mayor, to determine the appropriate tax rate for your city.",

However, the mayor has the discretion to use it for any purpose, be it for city needs or personal desires. Insufficient funds can lead to the city's deletion. Each week, during maintenance calculations, the city draws the required amount. If the treasury is lacking, the city, along with its civic structures, will be deleted.

Simply owning a house within the city doesn't grant citizenship; one must join via the city stone. Otherwise, these residents occupy space without contributing, living tax-free.
